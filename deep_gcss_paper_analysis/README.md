# DeepGCSS Paper Analysis
In this project we were given a paper written by our professor and asked to read it and create a project that would allow us to teach the paper to the class. My main portion was on the mathematics of the paper, namely the parameterization and smoothing steps and what makes the model in question distinctly a deep learning model not just a run of the mill machine learning model. I was also responsible for explaining what GCSS (Gaussian Curvature Scale Space) means and then also compared it to other methods like affine parameterization.
