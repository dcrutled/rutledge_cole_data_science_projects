# Mock Makeup Company Database
This project was the final for my database management project and was done in SQL. We created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) based on a fake makeup company as well as data for every table then built the database in SQL. I also included a file called "final_update", this was part of the final for my database class but shows that I'm familiar with various SQL operations.
